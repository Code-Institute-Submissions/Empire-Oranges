# Empire Oranges | A fresh fruit delivery service.

Code Institute Milestone Project 1 - Static Front End Website

This project is a website that contains three pages: the home page, gallery and sign up. The purpose of this website is to attract and inform new customers by a simple, but strong, visual design. The website contains functional information, such as brief description of the subscription benefits, an image gallery and an FAQ section.

## Introduction

My project is called ‘Empire Oranges’. It is a work of fiction, but as a concept seems to fit in well with culture lately. Every big company/ corporation wants you to join their subscription based service, and we see this vehemently with television networks using mobile phones as their platform. So, as I was reflecting on this as well as the current state of the world, with no one allowed out of their homes anymore, I thought to myself, it would be an amazing niche if there was someone offering a subscription based service for fresh fruits right now, and especially oranges. Pretty much guaranteed healthy food delivered to you regulary with out having to leave the comfort of your couch. So the company "Empire Oranges" are an old, family run business. Established over 200yrs ago, and are now global, with farms all over the world and looking to modernize business practices and begin diversifing their product placement, mostly by implementing a new subscription based service. As times are changing, they still remain in touch with their rustic Spanish roots, and this can be seen when you visit one of their farm cottages. The hospitality is to die for. 

Empire Farms have been supplying oranges to local supermarkets and fruit & veg markets their entire lives, this has been a trying and tumultuous path, leading to millions of pounds's worth of food wastage due to fruits just sitting around, rotting, and catching flies in the open air. The new service aims to reduce shelf time by going directly to the customer, right at home. Cutting down tons of food waste, bringing the fruit to the customer quicker than supermarket home delivery services too and its already having a positive impact in cities surrounding their farms. So to celebrate a step in the company's new direction Empire Oranges needed a new website to promote the new service. My project is to develop a visually attractive and informative website for Empire Oranges, that can bring to life the idea of fruit being delivered straight to a customers doorstep.

### Wireframes 
As part of the development process I created three wireframes for my website using [Balsamiq]
This was at the start of the project and helped me work towards my final result. When you compare them as a 'before' and my final result as the 'after' you can see some features were left out amd some design elements where changed but overal you can see the wireframes have had an impact.

Below are the examples for each of my pages:

## Features

+ **Navbar:** - a responsive navbar that changes depending on what size screen your device is - making for easier usability
+ **Benefits of Subscribing:** - a key feature of the home page which directly catches user attention
+ **Gallery:** - Three large images showcasing the very best the company has to offer, with a descriptive paragraph 
+ **Mini Gallery:** - Smaller pictures underneath larger ones showing other varieties of oranges
+ **Prices:** - The most important section, after the signup box, informing the customer on how much they can expect to pay
+ **FAQ:** - A list of questions customers might find themselves asking a lot and helpful having answered
+ **Sign Up Form:** - The most important feature, a simple box which when used connects the customer to the world of fresh fruit delivered monthly
 
### Existing Features

+ **Navbar:** allows users to view/ navigate the entire website with ease and without any awkward 'clicking to go back or forward', allows for comfortable browsing on mobile devices. I particularly enjoyed the Whiskey Drop tutorial with Code Institute and it inspired me with my navbar in this project
+ **Benefits of Subscribing:** when you first arrive on the home page you are greated with the fact its a subscription service and its offering to save you time and money and provide a lot of choice of oranges
+ **Gallery:** allows users to see the top three best selling products from the range of products
+ **Mini Gallery:** allows user to see the rest of the products, if they are interested in knowing more than the top 3 
+ **Prices:** allows users to understand the upfront, monthly costs of the service and what they are expected to be receiving
+ **FAQ:** allows users to find out what the answers are to questions they might have
+ **Sign Up Form:** allows users to input their email address and start the journey of getting ornages monthly

**Me**: I feel these features currently achieve what both customers and the business want from the website

### Future Features

+ **Customer feeback/ reviews:** would help future customers decide on which products to buy
+ **Map of Farms:** Some customers love a little getaway in the countryside, and what better place to have it than on an orange farm
+ **Loyalty Program:** Birthday Emails and Discount vouchers, entice customers to keep returning. Good for business

**Me**: I feel these features would add a more fuller experience to families and friends looking to have time away, or time together 

### Features Left to Implement

- ***Contact Page:*** Gives customers more of a direct line of contact with human representatives from the company
- ***A family section:** having a part of the website dedicated to families and children entertainment - recipes, colouring pictures (downloadable pdf, easy to implement)
- ***Online Shop:*** Adding a shop so customers can buy from the entire catalouge of Empire Orange products
- ***User Account:*** Customers can keep their details safe, see order history

**Me**: I feel these features left to implement will add a richer user experience, especially being able to have an account, shop for whatever I wanted and get in touch if i had a concern

## Testing

During this project I created a repository for it on github and accessed it through gitpod workspaces. Every change in the html/ css file was saved and then run locally by entering 'python3 -m http.server' into the terminal to view changes. If changes were successful I added the file to the git server by inputting 'git add (file name)' and then committed the files with a corresponding message indicating what changes had been made by inputting 'git commit -m "changes". After that I pushed the files to my repository using 'git push' 

### Stories

- _As a user of the website, I want everything layed out in a familiar way, with simple intuitive access to links._
  - I ensured that the layout of the wesbite had a navigation bar at the top of the screen, the footer was at the bottom of the screen, and the website itself had visible links with white text and big yellow sign up buttons.

- _As a user of the website, I don't want to wait for the website to load, I want quick and fast loading times._
  - I ensured that the images were compressed online using a compressor to reduce file size, enabling for quicker loading times

- _As a user of the website, I want to see the range of products on offer, to know what I can expect._
  - I ensured that the website featured a responsive gallery so that anyone viewing it on any device could see the products.

- _As a user of the website, I need to be able to contact anyone from the organisation, regardless of how big the company is._
  - A contact form is something which needs to be addressed, and can be done so at a later time

- _As a user of the website, I want to know I can have my doubts and questions answered, right there in front of me on the page._
  - I ensured that the website featured a FAQ section, helping customers answer frequently asked questions without the need to contact the company

- _As a user of the website, I want to know that when I submit my email address, its actually a working link._
  - I ensured that the email form has a working link, which opens up to a new page.

      1. I went to the Prices at the top of the signup page
      2. Clicked on each of the buttons '**Try for free, today!**, **Sign me up!**, **Let's get started!**' inside each price box
      3. Links redirected to signup form, verifying that it works
   
   10. 'Sign up' email form:   
       1. Submitted an empty form
          1. I went to the signup form at the bottom of the signup page
          2. Clicked on the 'Sign up' button inside the box

          3. Then I clicked on the 'Sign up' button inside the box
          4. I was redirected to the corresponding link, verifying that it works
   
_In Conclusion:_ While initially setting up the href to the correct corresponding output, I still went through and individually tested each link, if there was a link that wasn't working I opened Chrome Dev tools to have a look at the code and see why 

2. **Responsiveness:** 

While creating my website I used the bootstrap grid system to make the website responsive, adding rows and colums to most of my websites features.  

Features on my website that work well with the responsiveness:
- Navbar: changes depending on what size screen your device is making for easier usability, and taking up less screen real estate. On mobiles, collapses into a hamburger icon with expandable menu revealing 'home, oranges (with expandable dropdown menu) and signup. Sign up button disappears altogether
- Footer: changes depending on what size screen your device is making for easier usability, and taking up less screen real estate. On mobiles, shrinks into a single column without the logo or disclaimer text
- Jumbotron: the header text on the hero banner changes content depending on screen size
- Subscription benefits: The three paragraph sections respond differenlty on different screen sizes, from a row of three paragraphs down to a row of two with the third feature wrapping to the row beneath and centraly aligning itself, down to a single column taking up full width of screen device. The icons on each benefit header disappear on small mobile screens
- Gallery: the three photos in the gallery respond to screen sizes to, from a row of three, down to two rows of two with a fourth picture appearing down to a single column taking up a devices full width. Text paragraphs respond to responsive display and shrink with screen size.
- Mini gallery: a single row of pictures underneath the main gallery, responsively changing to screen size from a row of four down to a row of three, down to two rows of two. Image sie is responsive too.
- Prices: The three price sections respond differenlty on different screen sizes, from a row of three paragraphs down to a row of two with the third feature wrapping to the row beneath and centraly aligning itself, down to a single column taking up full width of screen device
-FAQ: the questions and answers section responds to screen size, the text wraps and stays aligned.
-Signup form: the size of the sign up form changes depending on what screen size you are viewing it in

_In Conclusion:_ The responsive features make the website better to use overal, making customers feel valued as they can open it on any device and the company benefits from it as they get to keep customers.

3. **Colour:** 
While developing my website I used various online tools to determin which colours I wanted and which worked well together.
I used Chrome dev tools to determine the contrast of text colour, and see if either the black/white coloured text worked well with the choice of background colour. If the dev tool showed a red X next to constrast I new those colours did not go well together.

_In Conclusion:_ I've found colours that work really well together, and as a result it leaves a really good looking website that customers would love.

4. **Images:** 
I reduced the size of the images, to improve loading times. I did this by using an online compressor

_In Conclusion:_ My website has been loading quicker.

### Bugs
I used a free service from [mobiReady](https://ready.mobi/) to test my website performance on mobile devices.
It revealed a lot of interesting things, the biggest issue is with my **CSS Measurements**, I used far too many absolute sizes for a lot of things on my website. Absolute dimensions and positions in CSS directives should be avoided as they will not render correctly on all device types, and is something I still haven't addressed yet and will do in the future.
