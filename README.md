My project is called ‘Empire Oranges’. It is a work of fiction, but as a concept seems to fit in well with culture lately. Every big company/ corporation wants you to join their subscription based service, and we see this vehemently with television networks using mobile phones as their platform. So, as I was reflecting on this as well as the current state of the world, with no one allowed out of their homes anymore, I thought to myself, it would be an amazing niche if there was someone offering a subscription based service for fresh fruits right now, and especially oranges. Pretty much guaranteed healthy food delivered to you regulary with out having to leave the comfort of your couch. So the company "Empire Oranges" are an old, family run business. Established over 200yrs ago, and are now global, with farms all over the world and looking to modernize business practices and begin diversifing their product placement, mostly by implementing a new subscription based service. As times are changing, they still remain in touch with their rustic Spanish roots, and this can be seen when you visit one of their farm cottages. The hospitality is to die for. 

Empire Farms have been supplying oranges to local supermarkets and fruit & veg markets their entire lives, this has been a trying and tumultuous path, leading to millions of pounds's worth of food wastage due to fruits just sitting around, rotting, and catching flies in the open air. The new service aims to reduce shelf time by going directly to the customer, right at home. Cutting down tons of food waste, bringing the fruit to the customer quicker than supermarket home delivery services too and its already having a positive impact in cities surrounding their farms. So to celebrate a step in the company's new direction Empire Oranges needed a new website to promote the new service. My project is to develop a visually attractive and informative website for Empire Oranges, that can bring to life the idea of fruit being delivered straight to a customers doorstep. 

Empire Oranges wants to;
+ Diversify their product placement 
+ Eliminate food waste 
+ Be an environmentally sustainable brand 
+ Produce & sell high quality oranges.

 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing
for delevopment and testing python3 -m http.server

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
