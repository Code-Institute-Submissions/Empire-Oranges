# Empire Oranges | A fresh fruit delivery service.

Code Institute Milestone Project 1 - Static Front End Website

This project is a website that contains three pages: the home page, gallery and sign up. The purpose of this website is to attract and inform new customers by a simple, but strong, visual design. The website contains functional information, such as brief description of the subscription benefits, an image gallery and an FAQ section.

## Introduction

My project is called ‘Empire Oranges’. It is a work of fiction, but as a concept seems to fit in well with culture lately. Every big company/ corporation wants you to join their subscription based service, and we see this vehemently with television networks using mobile phones as their platform. So, as I was reflecting on this as well as the current state of the world, with no one allowed out of their homes anymore, I thought to myself, it would be an amazing niche if there was someone offering a subscription based service for fresh fruits right now, and especially oranges. Pretty much guaranteed healthy food delivered to you regulary with out having to leave the comfort of your couch. So the company "Empire Oranges" are an old, family run business. Established over 200yrs ago, and are now global, with farms all over the world and looking to modernize business practices and begin diversifing their product placement, mostly by implementing a new subscription based service. As times are changing, they still remain in touch with their rustic Spanish roots, and this can be seen when you visit one of their farm cottages. The hospitality is to die for. 

Empire Farms have been supplying oranges to local supermarkets and fruit & veg markets their entire lives, this has been a trying and tumultuous path, leading to millions of pounds's worth of food wastage due to fruits just sitting around, rotting, and catching flies in the open air. The new service aims to reduce shelf time by going directly to the customer, right at home. Cutting down tons of food waste, bringing the fruit to the customer quicker than supermarket home delivery services too and its already having a positive impact in cities surrounding their farms. So to celebrate a step in the company's new direction Empire Oranges needed a new website to promote the new service. My project is to develop a visually attractive and informative website for Empire Oranges, that can bring to life the idea of fruit being delivered straight to a customers doorstep.

### Wireframes 
As part of the development process I created three wireframes for my website using [Balsamiq]
This was at the start of the project and helped me work towards my final result. When you compare them as a 'before' and my final result as the 'after' you can see some features were left out amd some design elements where changed but overal you can see the wireframes have had an impact.

Below are the examples for each of my pages:

## Features

+ **Navbar:** - a responsive navbar that changes depending on what size screen your device is - making for easier usability
+ **Benefits of Subscribing:** - a key feature of the home page which directly catches user attention
+ **Gallery:** - Three large images showcasing the very best the company has to offer, with a descriptive paragraph 
+ **Mini Gallery:** - Smaller pictures underneath larger ones showing other varieties of oranges
+ **Prices:** - The most important section, after the signup box, informing the customer on how much they can expect to pay
+ **FAQ:** - A list of questions customers might find themselves asking a lot and helpful having answered
+ **Sign Up Form:** - The most important feature, a simple box which when used connects the customer to the world of fresh fruit delivered monthly
 
### Existing Features
+ **Navbar:** allows users to view/ navigate the entire website with ease and without any awkward 'clicking to go back or forward', allows for comfortable browsing on mobile devices. I particularly enjoyed the Whiskey Drop tutorial with Code Institute and it inspired me with my navbar in this project
+ **Benefits of Subscribing:** when you first arrive on the home page you are greated with the fact its a subscription service and its offering to save you time and money and provide a lot of choice of oranges
+ **Gallery:** allows users to see the top three best selling products from the range of products
+ **Mini Gallery:** allows user to see the rest of the products, if they are interested in knowing more than the top 3 
+ **Prices:** allows users to understand the upfront, monthly costs of the service and what they are expected to be receiving
+ **FAQ:** allows users to find out what the answers are to questions they might have
+ **Sign Up Form:** allows users to input their email address and start the journey of getting ornages monthly

**Me**:I feel these features currently achieve what both customers and the business want from the website

### Future Features

+ **Customer feeback/ reviews:** would help future customers decide on which products to buy
+ **Map of Farms:** Some customers love a little getaway in the countryside, and what better place to have it than on an orange farm
+ **Loyalty Program:** Birthday Emails and Discount vouchers, entice customers to keep returning. Good for business

**Me**: I feel these features would add a more fuller experience to families and friends looking to have time away, or time together 

### Features Left to Implement
- ***Contact Page:*** Gives customers more of a direct line of contact with human representatives from the company
- ***A family section:** having a part of the website dedicated to families and children entertainment - recipes, colouring pictures (downloadable pdf, easy to implement)
- ***Online Shop:*** Adding a shop so customers can buy from the entire catalouge of Empire Orange products
- ***User Account:*** Customers can keep their details safe, see order history

**Me** : I feel these features left to implement will add a richer user experience, especially being able to have an account, shop for whatever I wanted and get in touch if i had a concern

## Testing


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. for delevopment and testing python3 -m http.server

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

### Test Scenarios

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment


### GitHub Pages

To deploy the website on github pages, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Open GitHub and go to your site's **'Repositories'**
2. Go to **'Settings'**
3. Scroll down until you see **'GitHub Pages'**
4. Under GitHub pages, click on the dropdown under **'Source'** and select the **'Master Branch'** option
5. A green box should appear with the following message **'Your site is published at.../'**
6. After selecting this, you need to choose a **'Theme'**, this asigns a Jekyll file to your respository and allows your webiste to be accessable.


### GitPod - running code locally

To deploy the code locally using gitpod, the follow steps need to be taken:

1. Open GitPod, go to the **Workspace** your project is located in
2. Once laoded, go the **Console/ Terminal** located in the bottom 3rd of the screen
3. Input **'python3 -m http.server'** then press return
4. A dialouge box reading 'A service is available on port 8000' will show to the right. Click on 'Open Browser'
5. This runs your code locally allowing you to view your project in the browser. No deployment necessessary

Also thank you to the Student Care team, who helped me navigate this project while I was without a laptop for 4days in the middle of the project.

A big shout out to everyone answering questions on chatroom boards concerning HTML & CSS - I learnt so much more from reading the comments than getting the answers.

### Content

I especially wanna thank Elisa Perks for helping me mull over my ideas and flesh them out.
We came up with the subscription service together, however I wrote out all the code, reaad a lot of bootstrap documentation and sourced the information and images on oranges.

- Code for the navbar copied from Code Institute Whiskey drop tutorial
